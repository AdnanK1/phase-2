## Problem statement

The current challenge faced by HomeLink Realty is the lack of a comprehensive system to provide homeowners with accurate and informed advice regarding home renovations and their potential impact on the estimated value of their properties. Without clear guidance on the expected increase in value resulting from renovations, homeowners may struggle to make informed decisions about investing in home improvements, hindering their ability to maximize the value of their properties and potentially impacting their overall real estate goals.

## Main Objective

The primary objective is to leverage Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) modeling techniques to identify the key features of renovated homes that significantly impact their market value during the buying and selling process. By employing robust statistical analysis, HomeLink Realty aims to provide homeowners with valuable insights into which specific renovations or home improvement projects yield the highest return on investment. This objective seeks to empower homeowners with data-driven guidance, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding renovations that will enhance their property's market value and maximize their potential gains in the real estate market.

## Conclusion

* Houses situated on waterfronts and possessing luxurious features significantly increase the house price by a substantial amount. Additionally, it is crucial for the house to be in good condition to ensure that the price does not fall below the expected amount.

* The presence of a waterfront location and luxurious amenities greatly enhances the desirability and market value of a house. Buyers are often willing to pay a premium for these sought-after features, leading to a significant increase in the house price.

* Furthermore, maintaining the house in good condition is essential to preserve its value. A well-maintained property with no significant flaws or deficiencies is more likely to attract potential buyers and command a higher price in the market. Neglecting maintenance or allowing the condition of the house to deteriorate may result in a decrease in its value, potentially falling below the expected price.

* Therefore, to maximize the house price and ensure its market value remains high, it is vital to prioritize waterfront locations, luxurious features, and consistent upkeep of the house's condition.

## Recommendations

* To find houses with high value, it is recommended to look for properties with waterfront locations and luxurious features, as these factors have a significant positive influence on the predicted house price. Such houses are likely to be priced competitively given their desirable attributes.

* Additionally, when selling a house, having good overall condition is crucial. Buyers are often willing to pay more for houses in good condition. Therefore, it is advisable to ensure that the house is well-maintained and in good shape to maximize its selling potential and attract higher offers.

* In cases where the house is not in good condition, undertaking necessary repairs and improvements can significantly increase its value. Investing in renovations and upgrades that enhance the overall quality and appeal of the property can make it more attractive to potential buyers, thereby raising its value in the market.

* By considering these factors and taking appropriate actions, both buyers and sellers can make informed decisions to maximize the value and attractiveness of the house in the real estate market.
